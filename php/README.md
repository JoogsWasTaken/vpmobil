# PHP

This directory contains PHP code for internal use.

* [config.php](config.php) - Settings for development, was never used
* [verifizierer.php](verifizierer.php) - Authentication management

The script `ga.php` is not included because it contained Google Analytics code (which I don't condone anymore, might I add).
