# VPMobil

This repository contains the archived source code for the substitution plan web app I wrote for my school back in 12th grade. If you want to read about how it came to be and how I see it after five years, [check out my website where I wrote an article on VPMobil](https://owlspace.xyz/dev/vpmobil).

## But why?

At the time of writing, it's been five years since I left school. I gave my school the responsibility of maintaining the web app. Only one year and a half after leaving, the web app was no longer accessible with no prior warning. Luckily, my school forgot to revoke my FTP credentials so I was able to copy the web app's source code onto my local machine where it's been collecting dust for about three years.

I decided to publish the source code at the start of 2021. I think this is a cool testament to amateur 2016 progressive web app development with no advanced tooling and it's still one of my most favorite and weirdly sophisticated projects I ever worked on.

## What can I expect?

The repository contains the untouched original source code of the web app from 2016. It's messy, it's horrible and not up to current day best practices, so don't go into the source code looking for any advice on how to do things on the modern web.

Since German is my mother tongue, you will find a lot of variable names and comments written in German. I might decide to translate it in the future depending on how much attention this gets. Every directory contains a README describing its contents so you can see the bigger picture of how I used to organize my code projects back in the day.

## Can I contribute?

If you intend on sharing any source code improvements: no. The source code is meant to reflect exactly what I built in 2016 and nothing else. However, I might consider pull requests and issues regarding the READMEs to explain what's going on in the code.
